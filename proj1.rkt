;; a size is either 1, 2, or 3,
;; representing small, medium, large in that order

;; a player is either 'blue or 'orange

;; a square is a natural number between 0 and 8 inclusive

;; a piece is a (make-piece s p) where
;; - s is a size, and
;; - p is a player
(define-struct piece (size player))

;; an intro is a (make-intro p s) where
;; - p is a piece, and
;; - s is a square
(define-struct intro (piece square))

;; a shift is a (make-shift src dst) where
;; - src and dst are both squares
(define-struct shift (src dst))

;; a move is either
;; - an intro, or
;; - a shift

;; an inventory is a (listof piece)

;; a board is a (listof (listof piece)) of length exactly 9
;; representing the squares of the board.  Each square is represented
;; by a list of pieces, where the pieces are ordered from outermost
;; (i.e., biggest) to innermost (smallest).  An square with no pieces
;; is represented by the empty list.

;; The order of the 9 items in the list corresponds to the 
;; squares on the board as follows:
;; 0 1 2
;; 3 4 5
;; 6 7 8

;; a game is a (make-game next oinv binv board) where
;; - next is a player, 
;; - oinv ("orange inventory") is an inventory,
;; - binv ("blue inventory") is an inventory, and
;; - board is a board (per definition above)
